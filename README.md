### 4)Unsolved problems：
Lack of deep understanding of Linux and  network programming.
### 5)Plan for the next week:
Network programming.

## Week 2
### 1)Learning hours:
about 15-20 hours.
### 2)Learing progress:
Learned the konwledge points of network,such as socket,TCP/UDP,Network hierarchical model and Network protocol.trid to write basic code about Network programming.learned the conception of thread and process.
### 3）Your implementation of the tasks you have done this week:
Completed a simple C/S model (the client sends a string to serer,the server just pass the string back to the client ).code in server_echo.c,client_echo.c,some Error handler in wrap.c.
Besides,write code to serve multiple users by multithreading(the function is the same as above).code in server_thread.c.
### 4)Unsolved problems：
I/O multiplexing,some detailed points of network programming.
### 5)Plan for the next week:
Learn more about network programming，maybe 5G.
